#### PostgreSQL or SQLite

As database the PostgreSQL database system is being used. You need to install it first. You can download the ready-to-use package from [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or use apt:

To use the application, you need to clone the repository to your computer. This is done using the `git clone` command. Clone the project:

```bash
>> git clone https://github.com/vitallcore/python-project-52.git && cd python-project-52
```

Then you have to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
>> make install
```

Create `.env` file in the root folder and add following variables:
```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://{provider}://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}
